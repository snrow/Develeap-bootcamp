Lavagna
-------
1. Use sources found in `project` sub-directory. This is based on https://github.com/digitalfondue/lavagna. Read the DOCS!
   Note: You may find it easier to read documents on github.

2. Build it using maven:
   2.a. Manually - Use a maven container and mount sources as volume. As usual:
        - Maven projects are built using "mvn verify" in the folder containing the `pom.xml`.
        - The output of the build is written into the `target` sub-folder.
   2.b. Fat docker - create a Dockerfile based on a maven docker image:
        - COPY sources in.
        - Build.
        - Create an entrypoint that executes Lavagna.
   Notes:
   - You can use `demo.Dockerfile` as a reference BUT:
     - DO NOT wget the distribution (as this file does)! You MUST build the image yourself using maven.
     - DO NOT use CMD. Use ENTRYPOINT and an `entrypoint.sh` you write

3. Execute Lavagna in single Docker container using the file-based HSQLDB (i.e. no need for an external DB container).

4. Replace HSQLDB with a "real" database - MySQL. 
   - Use docker-compose to make it work with MySQL 5.7. Note that you will likely need to improve on your previous work.
   - Save data in a named volume, and make sure that Lavagna does not lose user work between 2 docker-compose executions (i.e. "up", "down" and "up" again)!
   - In your entrypoint, wait for database to listen on port 3306 before launching lavagna.
     Note: `depends_on` in the docker-compose file is NOT good enough.

5. It makes sense to put our application behind an nginx reverse proxy:
   - Security-wise.
   - Better serving of static content.
   - Ability to later add SSL termination and load balancing.
   5.a. Create a custom nginx container to:
        - Act as a reverse proxy from port 80 to the UN-EXPOSED application 8080.
        - Serve the static content (found in the webapp folder) DIRECTLY.
   5.b. Make it part of the compose file.

   Here is some relevant documentation:
   - http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server
   - http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location
   - https://www.keycdn.com/support/nginx-location-directive

6. Thin docker - create a Dockerfile based on a maven docker image and use multi-stage docker to create an alpine JRE based lavagna image. 
   - Note the difference in image size between step 2.b. and step 6.

7. Add another server, running in it's own container, which serves documentation on port 8081. Additional instructions are in the readme.

Self-checking:
At the end of the excercise you should be able to start 4 containers using "docker-compose up":
- db
- java backend
- nginx frontend
- documentation server

---

To hand in:
- A zip file with your name, containing a directory with your name, containing:
  - An `init.sh` executable which runs all the bash commands for your project to run on localhost.
  - Do not forget to include all the resources for it to work.
